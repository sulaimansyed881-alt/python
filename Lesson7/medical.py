# (Also clean the input so it becomes either 'Y' or 'N'.)

# 2) If `medical_cause` is 'Y':

# - Print that the student is allowed to attend the exam.

# 3) Otherwise (medical_cause is 'N'):

# a) Ask for the student’s attendance percentage and store it in `atten`.

# b) If `atten` is 75 or more:

# - Print "Allowed"

# c) Else:

# - Print "Not allowed"
